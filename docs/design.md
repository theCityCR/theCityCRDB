# Design Status

theCityCRDB is implemented as small, testable systems slices. The current codebase has moved past
the initial scaffold and now includes working storage, parsing, execution, indexing, persistence,
WAL recovery, transactions, tests, benchmarks, and CI.

## Implemented Milestones

1. Repository foundation: CMake targets, CLI, library target, GitHub Actions CI, formatting-ready
   source layout, and project documentation.
2. Storage engine: typed columns, nullable values, schema validation, table/database ownership,
   page-backed `RowStore`, `VectorRowStore`, `BufferPool`, index maintenance, and MVCC version
   recording.
3. Parser: tokenizer, AST, grammar tests, table-management commands, predicates, ordering, limits,
   joins, transactions, prepared statements, save/load, and exit.
4. Query execution: projection, filtering, ordering, limit, insert, update, delete, table
   management, joins, prepared execution, save/load, recovery, and transactional read routing.
5. Indexes: maintained hash indexes for equality lookup and ordered B+ tree index APIs for point
   and range lookup.
6. Persistence: versioned binary snapshots for database schemas, rows, and index definitions.
7. WAL and recovery: append-only logical WAL, startup replay, save checkpoints, and recovery tests.
8. Concurrency: executor-level reader/writer synchronization and concurrent client tests.
9. Transactions: transaction manager, transaction states, snapshot rollback, MVCC row-version store,
   and active-transaction reads routed through MVCC table APIs.
10. Quality: GoogleTest coverage, regression tests, sanitizer script, coverage script, benchmark
    target, and multi-platform CI.

## Current Architecture Choices

- `Table` owns schema validation and index maintenance, while row storage is delegated to the
  `RowStore` interface.
- `PageRowStore` is the default row store. It groups rows into logical pages and mirrors serialized
  page bytes through the LRU `BufferPool`.
- `VectorRowStore` remains available as a simple in-memory implementation for focused tests and
  comparisons.
- Hash indexes provide fast equality lookup. `BTreeIndex` provides ordered lookup APIs and keeps
  explicit node/page metadata, but still rebuilds its shallow layout from ordered entries on write.
- The executor uses a rule-based planner that selects a full scan, hash index equality lookup, or
  ordered index range lookup.
- Persistence uses versioned binary snapshots. WAL recovery replays logical SQL payloads after the
  latest save checkpoint.
- Transactions currently combine transaction state tracking, MVCC read APIs, and snapshot-copy
  rollback. This keeps behavior explainable while leaving room for real undo/redo and commit
  visibility.

## Known Limitations

- Row IDs are positional. Deletes compact storage, which can shift later row IDs.
- Page payloads are serialized into the buffer pool, but typed rows remain the operational source
  of truth inside `PageRowStore`.
- B+ tree insert/delete operations rebuild node layout rather than incrementally splitting and
  merging pages.
- Transaction rollback restores a cloned database snapshot rather than applying undo records.
- MVCC does not yet enforce full isolation levels or conflict detection.
- WAL records are logical and replay SQL operations; there is no physical redo log yet.
- The planner does not collect statistics or perform cost-based optimization.
- SQL support is intentionally limited and does not include aggregation, grouping, subqueries, or
  general DDL.

## Next Engineering Plan

1. Introduce stable row IDs with tombstones and free-list reuse.
2. Make `PageRowStore` load rows from page bytes so page storage becomes the source of truth.
3. Replace snapshot rollback with undo records or MVCC commit visibility.
4. Implement incremental B+ tree page split/merge logic with invariants tests.
5. Harden recovery with physical redo records and crash-simulation regression tests.
6. Add statistics to tables and indexes, then evolve the planner toward a cost model.
7. Expand SQL support with aggregates, `GROUP BY`, and more join strategies.
8. Turn benchmark output into documented reports and trend comparisons.

## Definition of Done

Each feature should include:

- Public interface and implementation.
- Unit or execution tests for expected behavior and edge cases.
- Regression tests for bugs and non-obvious failure modes.
- SQL documentation updates when syntax or behavior changes.
- Benchmark updates when performance-sensitive paths change.
- Clean `ctest`, sanitizer, and coverage runs before merging.
